```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data Import

We are using the R Package CTIS to get access to the API Interface, more information on <https://github.com/CaroHaensch/CTIS>.

```{r Data Import}
devtools::install_github("CaroHaensch/CTIS")
library(CTIS)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
